# Topic Modelling Customer Feedback

# Business Context

The HealthyGym Group has approximately 2 million members and 600 gyms across the world (particularly in the UK, Denmark, and Switzerland). As one of the world’s largest value fitness operators, HealthyGym appeals to a broad range of customers by offering high-quality, low-cost, and flexible fitness facilities. The company’s customer-centric proposition – affordable membership fees, no fixed-term contracts, and 24/7 access to high-quality gyms – differentiates it from more traditional gyms and elevates it as a market leader within this space. 

This focus on the customer is centred on wanting to understand what motivates members to join and what factors influence their behaviours once they have joined. Understanding how to leverage innovative technology to influence, improve, and simplify their experience allows HealthyGym to foster an open, welcoming, and diverse environment for its members while maintaining the value proposition that HealthyGym is built upon.

With the shift in focus to value-for-money memberships across the gym industry, HealthyGym seeks to achieve its mission of ‘inspiring a healthier world by providing members with affordable access to the benefits being healthy can offer’. 

# Objective
HealthyGym aims to understand the factors influencing member reviews and scores, particularly aiming to identify what prompts negative feedback and how to leverage this information. They seek actionable insights to enhance member satisfaction. For this task, you will apply NLP techniques to analyse the reviews.

Temporal and spatial characteristics play a significant role in understanding user behaviour. Transforming the data into a time-series format and employing reverse geolocation lookups to visualise patterns can reveal valuable insights. For instance, if the data overlaps during specific time periods or if clusters of gyms in densely populated areas consistently receive negative reviews, this information will enhance our understanding of negative feedback. Due to time constraints, the above mentioned aspects will not be formally investigated as a part of this project activity. You are, however, encouraged to explore this as self-study. 

Not all negative reviews carry the same weight; the emotions expressed within them are often crucial. Conducting emotion analysis allows us to filter reviews based on specific emotions, such as ‘anger’, which frequently triggers negative feedback. By understanding these emotionally charged reviews, businesses can make targeted improvements to enhance the overall customer experience.

By consistently applying, collating, and evaluating these techniques over time, we can uncover actionable insights and identify the key drivers behind user reviews and scores.
